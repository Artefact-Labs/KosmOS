<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![KosmOS Screen Shot](git_images/screenshot.png)](https://awesome.artefact-labs.com/kosmos)
This project was set up in order to present the extent of the capabilities of Artefact and Artefact-Creator.
It is a replica of the Windows 10 operating system.
But it also has a utilitarian aspect:
- Allows users to add their own applications to the site
- Allow to make their web applications better known

A list of used libraries is listed in the acknowledgements.
